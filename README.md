# Prompt Me Amadeus

```
Amadeus, Amadeus… Amadeus
Amadeus, Amadeus… Amadeus
Amadeus, Amadeus
Oh, oh, oh, Amadeus
Come and prompt me, Amadeus
```

Have you ever tried to get generative AI (GenAI) models like Nano Banana to return the exact style of image you wanted, but couldn't get it to produce consistent results? Or wondered why two coding tools which use the same model, like Antigravity and Gemini CLI, feel like they work in really differently from each other? It usually comes down to their **system prompt**.

A **system prompt** in GenAI is the prompt _before_ your prompt. It's the prompt that sets up the context, rules, and requirements, and is combined with your prompt to create the "real" prompt that gets passed to the model. When integrating GenAI into your projects, strong system prompts are one of the keys to getting consistent results out of the models you're using—you can think of them as the training you do to the model for your specific task.

**Prompt Me Amadeus** is a collection of interesting, useful system prompts for you to use in your projects. For as much as they are working prompts, they're also meant as demonstrations for what an effective system prompt may look like. Each prompt includes what models it's been tested with and a description of how it was generated and why it works.

## Using these prompts

While exact usage may vary from prompt to prompt, at the very least you should be able to copy the prompts into your GenAI tool of choice, followed by your user prompt (the thing you actually want to create) and have it work. For tasks you'll likely want to do multiple times, setting up something like a [Gemini Gem](https://gemini.google/overview/gems/) or a [custom GPT](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/8554397-creating-a-gpt) is a good place to start.
